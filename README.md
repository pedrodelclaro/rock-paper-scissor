# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game built as a project for The Odin Project's Javascript Foundations course.

Initially, this game will be set up to be played only from the console, but, in the next steps, a GUI will be implemented.

The objective here is to train JS's basic concepts, like functions, strings and variables.
